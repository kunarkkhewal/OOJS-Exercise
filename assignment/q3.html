        <b>Diffrence between bind() and call()</b><br>
        1. call() Accepts additional parameters as well, whereas bind() works with object name itself <br>
        2. call() Executes the function it was called upon right away, in bind() you can call the function later <br>
        3. The call() method does not make a copy of the function it is being called on, whereas in bind() you can
        instantiate for later use.
